# ResumeProjects
In this repository I highlight my Final Projects I've worked on throughout the courses in my Bachelors in C.I.S

In the Final CIS 3365 Group Project, my group and I developed a GUI Prototype using ERD's and SQL Scripts to help a customer with their database system.
In my First Python Project in CIS 2348, I developed a Python Code to create an interactive query for a User looking to navigate through items and data.
